/**
 * Build the `permission` ruleset for a subagent's session when it's spawned
 * via the task tool. Combines:
 *
 * 1. The parent session's deny rules and external_directory rules.
 *    Parent agent restrictions only govern that agent; the subagent's own
 *    permissions determine its capabilities.
 * 2. Default `todowrite` deny if the subagent's own ruleset doesn't already
 *    permit it.
 *
 * NOTE: The `task` tool is NOT auto-denied here. The parent controls task
 * permissions via `disableTaskTool` in promptOps (for persona subagents) or
 * via the subagent's own `permission` ruleset. This allows general/explore
 * subagents (e.g. spawned by `/research`) to chain-delegate when needed.
 * Depth-limited spawning is managed by the parent agent, not by blanket deny.
